# Data Available

## What?
There is scarcity of data in certain areas, missing chunks of information, gaps in the matrix.
By adding these chunks is my attempt to close the gaps, fill in blank areas and mend the matrix.

## Why?
I think data should be available and possible to fetch, parse, transform, from whereever to wherever, for just about any purpose.
