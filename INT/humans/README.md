# Humans - Measurements and Sizes

## Shoe sizes

As this is a problem for me to find shoes as I have large feet, I usually order shoes based on the inner measurements. Through the years I have worn shoes labeled EU/43 through EU/49, that is quite a span of sizes even though my feet has not changed in size; the variation is from each and every manufacturer and model of shoe. This is just for EU-sizes, if I add US, UK and JP the sizes vary even more. I wish there were a global shoe size system - where your physical measurements matched a span of inner shoe measurements.


Example: My feet measures 290 millimeters from toe to heal and about xx milimeter from left to right.


I would like to see actual measurements of shoes in stead of locally or regionally made up size systems, "290-xx", that would tell me the most significant measurements, if the shoe would fit or not right at the start. My feet would accept shoes in the range of 290 to 295 mm, in combination with the second variable, the width, which would work similarly, inside a certain range would be acceptable.
