# Bicycle Frame numbers

Bicycle Frame numbers are used for insurance and theft/trace matters, I've been trying to collect and arrange some information around this as this is somewhat hidden and obscure.



## Manufacturing years
The letters allowed to symbolize a manufacturing years are ABCDEFGHJKLMNPRSTUVXZ.

Some are not allowed as they may be mistaken for other letters and/or numbers. 

* I (India)
* O (Oscar)
* Q (Quebec)
* Y (Yankee) 

There is of course exceptions from this

* 1956 has the letter Q, for unknown reasons. This was later adjusted to exclude letter Q after first roll-over.
